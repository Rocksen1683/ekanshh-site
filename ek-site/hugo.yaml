    content: |
      I am a Software Engineer based in Waterloo, ON :)) I love mathematics and engineering and strive to utilize them to build things that I find cool - be it a self-driving rover or a language learning app.

      Other than the tech-y stuff, I have a deep passion for Formula 1, movies and most importantly food. You can find me analyzing why Ferrari causes pain or cooking up my signature chocolate cheese sandwich.

      Some of my **allies**:
